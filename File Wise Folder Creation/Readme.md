There might be instances where you have around 15 + files in one folder and its correspondong assets in the same folder, and it might become difficult to navigate through,
this automation helps you read all the markdown files in a folder
Create a folder name in the same naming convention as your file name, but it follows Sensitive case (Captialize each word)

Here is an example of the expected output
**Before** :
<img width="660" height="890" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e80e0bc-aae7-4dff-b060-f194b7ed852f" />

I wanted to keep each of the areas and their projects in separate folders so that all the assets related to the specific project can be nicely organized in the same folder, I also like to ensure all the links and related files in the main project document are easily accessible in the same file as the main project file is (this really makes it easy to find something related while you are in a rush)
