Have you ever wondered how we can make our obsidian notes like that of Notion?

You can utilise the banner plugin.
However you would need to update the css a little bit to get this effect as show in the screenshot
Another thing to keep in mind is, the notes cover will never be visible during edit mode (unlike in notion), this feature is promised somewhere in the future however.
