This is useful to those who use the daily notes extension in Obsidian. For Journaling or to -do overview purpose
The daily notes is a great extension but it leaves the files in one single folder. Which becomes very difficult to track, index and revisit after you have started to maintained daily notes for atleast 2 months or more.
Hence this code is made with the intent to tag and folder your daily notes on the month basis

Here is an expected output structure which you can change

You can set this code using windows task scheduler for a daily archive/movement automation. 

The real idea behind this is to actual have your own digital garden with it's related assets under one folder. For instance you went to a cafe and you took a picture and want to remember it and associate it to that specific day, you can now do that by just running this code

Here are the two steps you need to follow to get the images in the same folder as the file or note
1. Run the code first before you take notes, so that the folder is created and the file gets move into there
2. Enable Default location for new attachments as "Same folder as current file"
